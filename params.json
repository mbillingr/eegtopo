Start up a terminal (or the command line)\r\n2. Change to the location of the binary file\r\n3. For a start, lets create an EEG layout consisting of 5 electrodes around Cz.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ eegtopo -e Fz C3 Cz C4 Pz -o laplacian.pdf\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates a file, laplacian.pdf, that shows schematically the locations of the electrodes Fz, C3, Cz, C4, and Pz.\r\n\r\nFor more advanced or fine-grained plots, you will need to create small script files."}
